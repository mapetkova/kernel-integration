# kernel-integration
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the code described in Petkova et al. 2017 (submitted).
The algorithm maps the density of SPH particles onto a Vornoi grid using the analytic integral of a cubic spline kernel function.
# Dependencies
The Voronoi grid is constructed using the free library Voro++ which can be downloaded from: http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/about.html
